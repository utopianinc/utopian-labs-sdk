## 0.1.9

Small bug fix in the /me endpoint. It used to throw an error, but that was unwanted behavior. Now it returns either a `success` or `error` status, depending on the validity of the API key.

## 0.1.8

Updated schemas to support sequence writing in the R1-copywriting agent.

## 0.1.2

Added /me endpoint for API key validation.
